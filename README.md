# Financial Records Analysis.

## Description

I have been tasked by a company to analyse the company's financial records.

The output of the analysis will consist of the following:
* Total number of months in dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the period of the dataset.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the period of the dataset.
* The date and value of the greatest increase in profits.
* The date and value of the greatest decresses in the losses.
