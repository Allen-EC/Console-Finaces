Code to analyse records for a company.

# Financial Records Analysis.

## Description

I have been tasked by a company to analyse the company's financial records.

The output of the analysis will consist of the following:
* Total number of months in dataset.
* The net total amount of Profits and Losses over the period of the dataset.
  * This is just the sum of all profits and losses in the dataset.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the period of the dataset.
  * This will be summing all the differences between all the adjacent months, and dividing by the number of months - 1. (The last month does not have a next month.)
* The date and value of the greatest increase in profits.
  * The month that recorded the biggest increase, and the change from the previous month.
* The date and value of the greatest decresses in the losses.
  * The month that recorded the biggest decrease, and the change from the previous month.

The output to the console should resemble the following:
